{% hint style="info" %}
The modular structure of the Open Systems Pharmacology Suite is explained in [Modules, Philosophy, and Building Blocks](modules-philsophy-building-blocks.md). Both PK-Sim® and MoBi® can be installed stand-alone. However, to obtain full modeling and simulation capabilities, we recommend that both programs are installed.
{% endhint %}

To install the Open Systems Pharmacology Suite core components:

1. Download installation packages from [http://setup.open-systems-pharmacology.org/](http://setup.open-systems-pharmacology.org/)
2. Start the **OSPSuite-Full.X.Y.Z.exe\*** \(where X.Y.Z is a program version, e.g. 7.4.0\) from the menu Start -&gt; Run or from Windows Explorer.
