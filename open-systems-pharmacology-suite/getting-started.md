# Getting Started

## Software and Hardware Requirements

| OS | Windows 7®, Windows 8®, Windows 10® |  |  |  |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Processor | minimum 1 GHz \(the faster, the better\) |  |  |  |
| Memory | 2 GB RAM, 3+ GB recommended |  |  |  |
| Disk space | minimum 2 GB |  |  |  |

Information provided above refers to the core components of the Open Systems Pharmacology Suite including PK-Sim®, MoBi®. Both, PK-Sim® and MoBi® can be installed as stand-alone software packages to reduce the disk space required.

{% hint style="warning" %}
The Open Systems Pharmacology Suite includes interfaces to MS Excel®, Matlab® \(version 2013b or later - 32 bit \) and R \(version 3.3 or later, 32 bit\). These are separate programs that are not available within the Open Systems Pharmacology Suite. You need to have these programs installed in order to use their interfaces!

### Trademark Information

Excel® is a registered trademark of Microsoft Inc., Redmond, USA; R is a product of the R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria; Matlab® is a registered trademark of The MathWorks, Inc., Natick, USA.

## Installation and Update

### Core Components

{% hint style="warning" %}
To correctly install the software, administrator rights are necessary. If you do not have these rights, your IT-administrator should carry out the installation.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
The modular structure of the Open Systems Pharmacology Suite is explained in [Modules, Philosophy, and Building Blocks](modules-philsophy-building-blocks.md). Both PK-Sim® and MoBi® can be installed stand-alone. However, to obtain full modeling and simulation capabilities, we recommend that both programs are installed.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
MoBi® Toolbox for Matlab® is currently only working with the 32- bit version of Matlab®.
{% endhint %}

To install the Open Systems Pharmacology Suite core components:

1. Obtain installation packages, either distributed via USB flash drive or to be downloaded from [https://github.com/Open-Systems-Pharmacology](https://github.com/Open-Systems-Pharmacology)

   An internet connection is required as software components such as .NET Framework \(in case the required version is not installed on the computer\) may need to be downloaded from server.

2. Start the Setup.exe from the menu Start -&gt; Run or from Windows Explorer.
3. Follow the instructions of the installation program. In most cases, the installation should be carried out with the default settings.
4. In most cases, you will have to restart your computer following installation.
5. Download PK-Sim® gene expression databases and copy it to a folder accessible for all users.
6. Configure PK-Sim® gene expression databases \(for details see [PK-Sim® - Options](../working-with-pk-sim-r/pk-sim-r-documentation/pk-sim-options.md).

### Third Party Tools

Besides the core components of the Open Systems Pharmacology Suite including PK-Sim®, MoBi®, as well as a compiled Matlab® runtime environment, interfaces are available for MS Excel®, Matlab® and R. For purchasing and installation options, please contact the suppliers indicated in section, “Trademark information”.
