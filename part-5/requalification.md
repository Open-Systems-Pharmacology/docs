# (Re-)Qualification framework

## Introduction

The qualification framework enables an automated validation of various scenarios (use-cases) supported by the OSP platform. This technical framework is used, for example, to release, in full confidence, a new version of the OSP Suite by verifying automatically that an ever-growing list of scenarios is performing as expected.

A qualification scenario can be performed after an evaluation of the involved PBPK models has been done. A PBPK model evaluation only contains the healthy adult model development, and is divided into the following steps:

- PBPK model **development and verification** with observed data
- Model evaluation plan generation ("*evaluation* plan" = "*qualification* plan **for one model**")
- Evaluation report generation ("*evaluation* report" = "*qualification* report **for one model**")

The workflow of a PBPK model evaluation is similar to that of a PBPK model scenario qualification. A qualification scenario can be based on a single PBPK model or several models and is divided into the following steps:

- Scenario qualification (**pure predictions**) with observed data (e.g. DDI scenario, Enzyme ontogeny scenario)
- Qualification plan generation
- Qualification report generation

![Overview](../assets/images/part-5/QualificationWorkflowOverview.png)

As a PBPK model evaluation workflow is similar to that of a qualification scenario, with the difference beeing model development and model application, respectively, the focus here will be on the scenario qualification workflow. In a first step, the qualification scenario is saved to a dedicated qualification repository on GitHub. This repository contains a detailed qualification plan that links and combines respective models and data describing the use case to qualify.
The qualification plan consists of:

- PK-Sim project files (more precisely: PK-Sim project file [**snapshots**](https://docs.open-systems-pharmacology.org/working-with-pk-sim/pk-sim-documentation/importing-exporting-project-data-models#exporting-project-to-snapshot-loading-project-from-snapshot))
- Descriptions of potential cross-dependencies between PK-Sim project files (if adequate) (e.g. it is possible to inherit building blocks or simulation parameters)
- Observed data sets (needed for model development and verification)
- Qualification scenario description text modules
- Detailed report settings related to the generation of charts and qualification measures.

{% hint style="tip" %}
Any file used in the qualification plan (e.g. PK-Sim projects, observed data sets, text modules etc...) can also be saved in an external repository and then conveniently referenced by the qualification plan.
{% endhint %}

![Repositries](../assets/images/part-5/QualificationWorkflowRepositories.png)

In the next step, the **Qualification Runner** (stand-alone tool) processes the qualification plan, i.e. all project parts are exported and prepared for the **Reporting Engine**. The Reporting Engine provides a validated environment (currently implemented in MATLAB®, a transfer to R is in development) for model execution and generates tables and figures for the final qualification report. This report contains the evaluation of the individual PBPK models with observed data (i.e. standard goodness of fit plot, residuals-vs-time plot, visual predictive checks) and a comprehensive qualification of the specific use case assessing the predictive performance of the OSP suite by means of a predefined set of qualification measures and charts.
The automated execution of the described workflow can be triggered to assess re-qualification, for example, when new data is available, after changes in model structure or parameterization, or when releasing a new version of the OSP Suite.

# Creating a (re-)qualification plan part I

Creating a qualification report is similar to writing a scientific article: A report is written and structured in chapters, for example beginning with a short description of the scientific background of the scenario (use-case), followed by a brief methodological description (e.g. modeling strategy, available data used during model building (for model evaluation report), and underlying main assumptions) and the presentation of the qualification workflow results in the third section of the report.

The qualification plan orchestrates this process and defines how all the _static_ and _dynamic_ content will be combined into the final report document.

- “_Static content_”: Will be taken AS IS and inserted into the report without any further modifications.

- “_Dynamic content_”: Software must actively do something to produce expected results (e.g. create plots). 
This content may change between OSP versions in case of differences between the previous and new model structures/parameterizations.

Technically, a qualification plan is nothing more than a text file in [JSON format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON) (file extension: **.json**). You can use any plain text editor for creating and modification of such a file. However, it is much faster and easier to use a json editor (e.g. the free _Visual Studio Code_ (_VSCode_); s. the section [**Creating a (re-)qualification plan part II: Tools**](#creating-a-re-qualification-plan-part-ii-tools) for details). Note that many scripting environments (Matlab, R, etc...) also allow for the comfortable editing of JSON files.

## Components of a (re-)qualification plan

![Overview](../assets/images/part-5/QualificationPlan_00_Overview.png)

### Projects

Describes all projects used in a qualification scenario. Currently, only PK-Sim projects are supported. MoBi projects will be supported in the mid-term future.

![Projects](../assets/images/part-5/QualificationPlan_01_Projects.png)

- "**Id**": Whenever a project is referenced within a qualification plan: it happens via its project id. Any non-empty string can be defined by the author of a qualification plan as a project id (the only restriction: a project id must be _unique_ within one qualification plan).

- "**Path**": path to a project **snapshot**. Can be defined:

  - Either in form of an URL of remote file (e.g. "_https://github.com/Open-Systems-Pharmacology/Sufentanil-Model/releases/download/v1.1/Sufentanil.json_"
  - or in form of a path to a LOCAL file (given **relative to the location of current qualification plan**), e.g. "_Input/Itraconazole-Model.json_")

- "**BuildingBlocks**": OPTIONAL, may be empty. List of inherited building blocks.

  The idea behind is: The use-case requires some building blocks (e.g. compound, individual, ...) to be exactly **the same in one or more projects**. Instead of modifying those projects by hand, the qualification plan can automate this action and ensure that building blocks are used consistently.

  - "**Type**": type of a building block (one of: "_Compound_", "_Event_", "_Formulation_", "_Individual_", "_ObserverSet_", "_Population_", "_Protocol_")
  - "**Name**": name of a building block (must be the same in both parent and child project)
  - "**Project**": Id of the parent project

  #### Example

  - Individual building block "_European (P-gp modified, CYP3A4 36 h)_" in the project "_Itraconazole-Midazolam-DDI_" will be overwritten by the Individual building block **with the same name** from the project "_Midazolam_" (if there is no individual with the same name in the "_Midazolam_" project: execution of the qualification plan will stop with an error)

  - Compound building block "_Midazolam_" in the project "_Itraconazole-Midazolam-DDI_" will be overwritten by the Compound building block **with the same name** from the project "_Midazolam_" (if there is no Compound with the same name in the "_Midazolam_" project: execution of the qualification plan will stop with an error)

  ![Project building blocks](../assets/images/part-5/QualificationPlan_02_Projects.png)

- "**SimulationParameters**": OPTIONAL: List of inherited simulation parameters (i.e. parameters that are not specified in building blocks, but in the simulation, e.g. `blood/plasma concentration ratio` or `P (interstitial->intracellular)`). Same principle as in case of inherited building blocks: simulation parameters can be inherited between projects. Each inherited simulation parameter description consists of:

  - "**Project**": Id of the parent project

  - "**Simulation**": Simulation name within the parent project

  - "**Path**": Path to the simulation parameter

  - "**TargetSimulations**": Simulation name(s) within child project

#### Example

- In all target simulations shown below (_DDI Control - xxx, DDI Treatment - xxx_), the value of parameter `P (interstitial->intracellular)` defined in `Neighborhoods|Duodenum_int_Duodenum_cell|Midazolam` will be set to the value of the same parameter in the simulation `po 3mg (solution)`

![Projects - simulation parameters](../assets/images/part-5/QualificationPlan_03_Projects.png)

### Observed data sets

Similar to a project, an observed data set is identified by its Id, which must be unique within a qualification plan.

There are two kinds of observed data set:

1. Observed data set which is included into one project used by the qualification plan.

   This data set can be used in the qualification plan without any further specification. The `Id` is, in this case, the name of the observed data set as defined in the PK-Sim project.

2. Observed data set which is not included into one project. It must be described in the "_ObservedDataSets_" section of a qualification plan.

   ![Observed data](../assets/images/part-5/QualificationPlan_04_ObservedData.png)

   - "**Id**": (Unique) id of an observed data set
   - "**Path**": path to an observed data set file. Can be given as remote URL or local file path (s. the [Projects](#projects) section for details).
   - "**Type**": type of an observed data set. Can be one of:
     - "_TimeProfile_". Corresponding observed data set must have the columns with time values, measurement values and (optionally) error values with units (s. also [here](https://docs.open-systems-pharmacology.org/shared-tools-and-example-workflows/import-edit-observed-data)). [Example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Open-Systems-Pharmacology/QualificationPlan/7ab7c59dfce9201845ebcd8247b2a5cad344bc03/examples/minimal/reporting%20engine%20input/ObservedData/Itraconazole%20600mg%20MD.csv)
     - "_PKRatio_". [Example](https://github.com/Open-Systems-Pharmacology/Pediatric_Qualification_Package_GFR_Ontogeny/blob/4e905c62f348a107e3cb96b7fe44c5f8e201da75/input/PK-Parameters.csv) Mandatory columns are: 
       * an ID number to reference to ('*ID*')
       * PK-parameter value and its unit (e.g '*AUC Avg*' and '*AUC AvgUnit*' for AUC; '*CL Avg*' and '*CL AvgUnit*' for CL etc.)
       * the simulation duration ('*t0*' ; '*tend*' ; '*t Unit*').
     - "_DDIRatio_". Example: TODO Mandatory columns are: 
       * a unique ID number to reference to ('*ID*')
       * a unique descriptive name (i.e. Author Year) ('*Study ID*')
       * the corresponding victim drug ('*Victim*')
       * the corresponding perpetrator drug ('*Perpetrator*')
       * the route of administration (e.g. PO, IV, ...) of the victim ('*Route Victim*')
       * the route of administration (e.g. PO, IV, ...) of the perpetrator ('*Route Perpetrator*')
       * the compartment (i.e. plasma, whole blood, etc.),  from which the victim drug PK parameters should be assessed ('*Compartment*')
       * the dose of the perpetrator ('*Dose*') and its unit ('*Dose Unit*')
       * the observed AUC ratio of the victim expressed as AUC with perpetrator divided by AUC without perpetrator ('*AUCR Avg*')
       * the observed C_max ratio of the victim expressed as C_max with perpetrator divided by C_max without perpetrator ('*CmaxR Avg*')
       * the time frame of the simulation without perpetrator, from which the simulated AUC and C_max of the victim should be calculated ('*t_placebo_0*' ; '*t_placebo_end*')
       * the time frame of the simulation with perpetrator, from which the simulated AUC and C_max should be calculated ('*t_treatment_0*' ; '*t_treatment_end*')
       * and the unit of the respective time definitions ('*t Unit*'). 
       
         Note that observed clearance ratios need to be transformed to AUC ratios before (adding a comment in the '*Comment*' column is recommended).

### Sections

Defines the chapter structure of the report. A `section` consists of:

- "**Id**": Unique section-Id. This id is referenced in other parts of the qualification plan to define which dynamic content must be added to the chapter (dynamic content will be added at the end of the chapter)

- "**Title**": Chapter title

- "**Content**": Path to the **static** content file which will be inserted at the beginning of the chapter. Can be given as remote URL or local file path (s. the [Projects](#projects) section for details). Static content files must be written in [Markdown](#Markdown) format (s. below).

- "**Sections**": OPTIONAL list of sub-sections. Every sub-section is built in the same way (thus report structure can be defined with an arbitrary chapter depth level).

  ![Sections](../assets/images/part-5/QualificationPlan_05_Sections.png)

{% hint style="tip" %}

#### Markdown

Markdown files are text files in Markdown format (file extension: **.md**).

Markdown is a way to style text on the web. You control the display of the document; formatting words as bold or italic, adding images, and creating lists are just a few of the things we can do with Markdown. Mostly, Markdown is just regular text with a few non-alphabetic characters thrown in, like `#` or `*`.

Good introductions into the markdown format can be found here:

- https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/

- https://help.github.com/en/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax

You can use any plain text editor for creating and modification of markdown files. However it is much faster and easier to use a dedicated markdown editor, e.g. _Typora_ (https://www.typora.io/)
{% endhint %}

### Intro

An (optional) introduction can be added to the report. The differences between introduction and sections are:

1. In the generated report, the introduction will be inserted at the very beginning, before the TOC (table of content) and is not part of the TOC.

2. The introduction does not have any Id and it is not possible to assign any dynamic content to it.

The introduction is defined by:

- "**Path**": Path to the **static** content file. Can be given as remote URL or local file path (s. the [Projects](#projects) section for details). Static content files must be written in [Markdown](#Markdown) format.

  ![Intro](../assets/images/part-5/QualificationPlan_06_Intro.png)

### Inputs

A convenient way to specify which building blocks and/or simulations should be described in the report as well as the section of the report where the descriptions should be located.

Each input entry definition consists of:

- "**Project**": Id of the project

- "**Name**": name of the building block or simulation to describe

- "**Type**": type of the building block/simulation (one of: "_Compound_", "_Event_", "_Formulation_", "_Individual_", "_ObserverSet_", "_Population_", "_Protocol_", "_Simulation_")

- "**SectionId**": Id of the section where the input description will be inserted.

Input description contains all input settings (model- type, calculation methods etc.) and all input parameters that deviate from the default incl. their value origins.

### Plots

This section defines the type of plots (and some additional related information like tables and qualification measures) to generate for the report.

![Plots](../assets/images/part-5/QualificationPlan_10_PlotOverview.png)

- "**PlotSettings**": OPTIONAL _Global_ plot settings (pictures size, font properties). In addition, every plot can define its _local_ plot settings.

  - If both (global and local) plot settings are defined for some plot: local settings will be used.
  - If neither global nor local plot settings are defined for some plot: program defaults will be used.

- "**AxesSettings**": OPTIONAL _Global_ axes settings **per plot type**. In addition, every plot can define its _local_ axes settings.

  - If both (global and local) axes settings are defined for some plot: local settings will be used.
  - If neither global nor local axes settings are defined for some plot: program defaults will be used.
  - Global axes settings can not be defined for "_AllPlots_"

  ```json
  "AxesSettings": {
    "ComparisonTimeProfile": [
      {
        "Unit": "h",
        "Dimension": "Time",
        "Type": "X",
        "GridLines": false,
        "Scaling": "Linear"
      },
      {
        "Unit": "ng/ml",
        "Dimension": "Concentration (mass)",
        "Type": "Y",
        "GridLines": false,
        "Scaling": "Log"
      }
    ],
  ```

- "**AllPlots**"; "**GOFMergedPlots**"; ... : different kinds of plots, explained in detail below.

#### AllPlots

All plots defined in the PK-Sim project _Project_ under simulation _Simulation_ will be placed into the report **using their settings defined in the PK-Sim project**. Thus one node from the "AllPlots"-section in the qualification plan will be expanded into N (N>=0) plots in the final report

```json
"AllPlots": [
  {
    "SectionId": 13,
    "Project": "Midazolam",
    "Simulation": "iv 0.001 mg (5 min)"
  },
  {
    "SectionId": 13,
    "Project": "Midazolam",
    "Simulation": "iv 0.05 mg/kg (2 min)"
  },
```

NOTE: at the moment, only Time Profile Plots (Individual and Population) will be exported.

#### GOFMergedPlots

    "GOFMergedPlots": [
      {
        "SectionId": 14,
        "Title": "Midazolam concentration in plasma/blood",

            "OutputMappings": [
              {
                "Project": "Midazolam",
                "Simulation": "iv 0.001 mg (5 min)",
                "Output": "Organism|PeripheralVenousBlood|Midazolam|Plasma (Peripheral Venous Blood)",
                "ObservedData": "Hohmann 2015 - iv 0.001 mg - Plasma - agg. (n=16)",
                "Color": "#FF0000"
              },
              ...

Two types of plots are supported here:

- Predicted vs. Observed

  ![](../assets/images/part-5/001_plotGOFMergedPredictedVsObserved.png)

- Residuals over time

![](../assets/images/part-5/003_plotGOFMergedResidualsOverTime.png)

      If you are not sure how such a path is defined:

      1. Open project in PK-Sim

      2. From the context menu of the simulation of interest: select "_Export simulation structure to file..._"

      3. Open exported file with a text editor and look for "_OBSERVER_"

      4. In the OBSERVER section: look for your output of interest and copy its path **without the leading simulation name**.

      E.g. in the example below correct output path for the qualification plan would be

      _Organism|PeripheralVenousBlood|Theophylline|Blood Cells_

      ```
      --------------- OBSERVER (Non zero only) ----------
      Observer: Blood Cells
      	Path: S1_diss|Organism|PeripheralVenousBlood|Theophylline|Blood Cells

## How generated artifacts are combined into a report

All static and dynamic elements described in a qualification plan are compiled into a report in the following order:

1. Intro (if defined in the qualification plan)

2. Table of Contents (is generated automatically)

3. (Top level) sections **in order of their appearance in the qualification plan**. Per section:

   3.1 Static content of the section

   3.2 For all inputs **with SectionId = Id of the current section**: generated input descriptions **in order of appearance in the qualification plan**

   3.3 For all plots **with SectionId = Id of the current section**: generated plots (and related artifacts) **in order of appearance in the qualification plan**

   3.4 Subsections of the current section (if any) **in order of appearance in the qualification plan**. Per subsection ... (s. 3.1..3.4)

# Creating a (re-)qualification plan part II: Tools

1. Install VSCode (Visual Studio Code).

   - Download User-Installer or System-Installer from https://code.visualstudio.com/Download

2) If you are behind a firewall: configure firewall proxy

   - Start VSCode

   - Go to File►Preferences►Settings

   - Then go to User Settings►Application►Proxy

   - Enter your Firewall-Proxy

3. Install the snippets file

   - Download _Snippets for Visual Studio Code_ (**qualification.code-snippets**) from https://github.com/Open-Systems-Pharmacology/QualificationPlan/releases/latest

   - Copy this file to `C:\Users\<USERID>\AppData\Roaming\Code\User\snippets`

     - In case you are using _portable_ version of VSCode: copy the snippets file to `<VSCode_InstallDir>\data\user-data\User\snippets` (create the folder if it does not exist)

   - Restart VSCode

4) Create/Edit a qualification plan

   - Create a new empty file and **save it as .json** (unless the file was saved as json, snippets will not work)
   - For every element of a qualification plan (project, plot, section, input) there is a **predefined code snippet**, which will create a skeleton of this element.
   - To use a snippet, type its **shortcut** and press ENTER
   - The full list of qualification plan snippets is given in the table below. **Parent node** column describes at which places of a qualification plan a snippet can be used.
   - The first snippet to be used is always `bs`(_bootstrap_) - this will create a skeleton of a qualification plan
   - All other snippets are defined as abbreviations of "Add XYZ".

- If you do not remember the shortcut of a snippet:
  _ either start typing: the list of all snippets starting with this shortcut will be shown via Intellisense
  _ or press CTRL+SPACE: the list of ALL snippets will be shown. Then just navigate to the right snippet and select it
  ![grafik](../assets/images/part-5/QualificationPlan_Tools_01.png)
- After you inserted a skeleton via snippet: fill all the placeholders with correct information. Just start typing (don't click with the mouse!) into the first entry; once finished - press TAB to switch to the next input
  ![GetImage](../assets/images/part-5/QualificationPlan_Tools_02.png)

- If a value to be entered is an enumeration: click between double quotes and press CTRL+SPACE, then select from the list
  ![GetImage2](../assets/images/part-5/QualificationPlan_Tools_03.png)

- If a Dimension/Unit pair has to be defined: select the dimension first (CTRL+SPACE), AFTER that select the unit

- When adding a new element of NON-EMPTY array, do not forget a comma before or after inserted element. (Before when inserted as last element, after otherwise).

Creation of a qualification report from a qualification plan requires installation of additional tools, which are not part of the OSP Suite setup. All required tools can be downloaded from

https://github.com/Open-Systems-Pharmacology/QualificationPlan/releases/latest

- **QualificationRunner**: download `qualificationrunner-portable-setup_X.Y.Z.zip` and unzip it into any folder on your hard disc.
- **Reporting Engine**. There are two installation options:

  1. In case you have a Matlab license: install as a source code. For this: download `Reporting.Engine.X.Y.Z.zip` and unzip it into any folder on your hard disc.

  2. In case you have no Matlab license: install as compiled library.

     1. Prerequisite: download and install free Matlab Compiler Runtime version 2017b

        http://ssd.mathworks.com/supportfiles/downloads/R2017b/deployment_files/R2017b/installers/win64/MCR_R2017b_win64_installer.exe

     2. Download `Reporting.Engine.Compiled.X.Y.Z.zip` and unzip it into any folder on your hard disc.

     3. Unzip folder contains the file `CreateQualificationReport.bat`. Adjust it (s. comments in the file)

- Markdown Joiner: Download **markdown-joiner.zip** and unzip it into any folder on your hard disc.

## Creating a report in Markdown format

A good starting point is https://github.com/Open-Systems-Pharmacology/Evaluation-plan-template.

Download this repository locally and adjust `Workflow.m` in the subfolder _Evaluation_ (s. comments in the file).

Execute Workflow.m.

- If you have a Matlab license: start Matlab and execute Workflow.m

- If you have no Matlab license:

  1. Start command prompt (_cmd_). In the command prompt:

     1. Switch to the folder where _Reporting.Engine.Compiled.X.Y.Z.zip_ was unzipped.

     2. Execute _CreateQualificationReport.bat "<full-path-to-Workflow.m>"_. E.g.

        `CreateQualificationReport.bat "C:\Evaluation-plan-template\Evaluation\Workflow.m"`

        ![cmd](../assets/images/part-5/CreateQualificationReport_CMD.PNG)

This will create a report in markdown format in the _Evaluation/report_ subfolder.

For any new qualification report: just create a new copy of _Workflow.m_ and adjust it for the new report.

### Converting Markdown report to pdf.

Different (commercial and free) markdown to pdf converters are available.
We recommend to use Typora (https://www.typora.io/) for this task.
