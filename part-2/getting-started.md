| ---------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Processor  | minimum 1 GHz (the faster, the better) |
| Memory     | 2 GB RAM, 3+ GB recommended            |
| Disk space | minimum 2 GB                           |
||              **Optional software**                 ||
| Matlab®    | version 2017b or later                 |
| R®         | versions 3.5 or later - 64bit          |


Information provided above refers to the core components of the Open Systems Pharmacology Suite including PK-Sim®, MoBi®. Both, PK-Sim® and MoBi® can be installed as stand-alone software packages to reduce the disk space required.

{% hint style="warning" %}
The Open Systems Pharmacology Suite includes interfaces to MS Excel®, Matlab® (version 2017b or later) and R (version 3.5 or later, 64 bit). These are separate programs that are not available within the Open Systems Pharmacology Suite. You need to have these programs installed in order to use their interfaces!

## Installation and Update

### Core Components

{% hint style="warning" %}
To correctly install the software, administrator rights are necessary. If you do not have these rights, your IT-administrator should carry out the installation.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
The modular structure of the Open Systems Pharmacology Suite is explained in [Modules, Philosophy, and Building Blocks](modules-philsophy-building-blocks.md). Both PK-Sim® and MoBi® can be installed stand-alone. However, to obtain full modeling and simulation capabilities, we recommend that both programs are installed.
{% endhint %}

To install the Open Systems Pharmacology Suite core components:

1.  Download installation packages from http://setup.open-systems-pharmacology.org/

2.  Start the **OSPSuite-Full.X.Y.Z.exe*** (where X.Y.Z is a program version, e.g. 7.4.0) from the menu Start -> Run or from Windows Explorer.

3.  Follow the instructions of the installation program. In most cases, the installation should be carried out with the default settings.

4.  In most cases, you will have to restart your computer following installation.

5.  Download PK-Sim® gene expression databases and copy it to a folder accessible for all users.

6.  Configure PK-Sim® gene expression databases (for details see [PK-Sim® - Options](../part-3/pk-sim-options.md)).

### Third Party Tools

Besides the core components of the Open Systems Pharmacology Suite including PK-Sim®, MoBi®, interfaces are available for MS Excel®, Matlab® and R. For purchasing and installation options, please contact the suppliers indicated in section, “Trademark information”.
